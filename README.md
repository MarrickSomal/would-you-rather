# Would You Rather

Would You Rather is a fully responsive and mobile-ready polling game that presents the user with a series of questions.

Any user can answer a question, with a subsequent results page highlighting their selected option and showing the number of overall votes for each option.

Users can also create their own questions, with a leaderboard displaying the rank of users based on their contribution to the game.

Game data is persisted in the browser's localstorage, allowing the user to return to their game with all their saved data at a later time. There is also an option to reset the game to its preset data.

The game is built with React, React Router, Redux and Redux Thunk.
